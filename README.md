# CloakedRobot

This is the simplest blog engine I could think of. Runs on ASP.Net MVC4 and RavenDB. Beign developed as I experiment with somethings.

Heavily inspired by RaccoonBlog, I wanted to give more design freedom and remove some features I considered as clutter.

The name was an awesome GitHub repository name suggestion.
